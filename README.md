## Summary
The primary advantage of refactoring code is the ground work being laid already for the code you intend to use. This makes it easier to make small edits to optimize the specifics of what the code does. The primary disadvantage though, is that the code is already mostly made, and so 

The advantage of the starting code is that it is already in a functional state, but the disadvantage is that it is not fully optimized and streamlined as well as it can be.
